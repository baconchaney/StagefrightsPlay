# Stagefright's Play - A Discord bot to help run the encounter from The Wild Beyond The Witchlight.

## About the project
I am currently running The Wild Beyond The Witchlight D&D campaign for my players and have always played online using various tools. I noticed that Stagefright's Play as written in the module required players to draw lines out of a hat to speak and are scored on how successful they are during this encounter. As we use Discord this wasn't really an option and I struggled to find an existing alternative without changing the virtual table top software that we are using (Talespire which is amazing) so figured I would create a Discord bot to help facilitate this.
